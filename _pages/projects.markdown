      </div>
    </div>
    <p class="team-card-bio">One of the most widely used platforms for visualizing and analyzing cancer genomics data. Fully open source, actively maintained by KSG @ DFCI, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, Princess Margaret Cancer Center, and <a href="http://thehyve.nl">The Hyve</a>. We also maintain a local instance of cBioPortal @ DFCI, enabling researchers to mine all genomic data generated by the Profile project.</p>

      </div>
    </div>
    <p class="team-card-bio">A next-generation trial matching platform that leverages large language models (LLMs) to match patients to all clinical trials — not just genomically driven ones — based on their full medical record. MatchMiner-AI processes unstructured clinical notes to extract key patient attributes and generate patient summaries for best-fit trial identification. Launched at DFCI in February 2026.</p>

      </div>
    </div>
    <p class="team-card-bio">Profile was a long-standing clinical next-generation sequencing (NGS) project between DFCI, Brigham and Women's Hospital, and Boston Children's Hospital. We developed clinical NGS pipelines and a cloud-based platform for running clinical NGS tests. We also supported ImmunoProfile, a research assay used to study and predict response to immunotherapy.</p>
