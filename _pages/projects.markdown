# AACR GENIE

Beyond sharing of software, we are also strong believers in "big data" for cancer and sharing of genomic data across multiple institutions.  DFCI is therefore a founding member of the <a href="http://www.aacr.org/Research/Research/Pages/aacr-project-genie.aspx#.VtcMH5MrJ0I">AACR Project GENIE</a>, a new initiative for sharing genomic data across multiple cancer centers.

# Cancer Immunologic Data Commons (CIDC)

<img style="float: right; margin: 20px" src="/knowledge-systems/assets/images/cimac.png" alt="CIMAC Logo" width=250px>

We are the data coordinating center for the <a href="https://cimac-network.org/">CIMAC-CIDC Immuno-Oncology Biomarkers Network</a>.  In collaboration with <a href="http://liulab.dfci.harvard.edu/">X. Shirley Liu</a>, we serve the bioinformatics needs of the network, optimization of data collection methodologies suitable for immune-related biomarkers, data integration and building of a biomarker database for the secondary use by the larger immuno-oncology community. The source code of the project is <a href="https://github.com/CIMAC-CIDC/">fully open and hosted on GitHub</a>. 

# cBioPortal for Cancer Genomics

<img style="float: right; margin: 20px" src="http://www.cbioportal.org/images/cbioportal_logo.png" width=250px>

The <a href="http://cbioportal.org">cBioPortal for Cancer Genomics</a> is one of the most widely used platforms for visualizing and analyzing cancer genomics data. The project is <a href="https://github.com/cBioPortal/">fully open source</a>, and is actively maintained by multiple groups, including KSG @ DFCI, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, Princess Margaret Cancer Center and <a href="http://thehyve.nl">The Hyve</a>.  We also actively maintain a local instance of cBioPortal @ DFCI, where we enable researchers at DFCI to mine all genomic data generated by the Profile project, our enterprise sequencing effort for all patients. 

# Human Tumor Atlas Network (HTAN)

Together with Sage Bionetworks, the Institute for Systems Biology, and Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, we are the Data Coordinating Center (DCC) for the Human Tumor Atlas Network (HTAN).  HTAN is a large "Moonshot" project funded by the National Cancer Institute, which will focus on longitudinal studies of pre-cancer, metastasis, and drug resistance with an emphasis on collecting comprehensive clinical data over time.  The DCC will be the central data coordinating center for the network. 


# MatchMiner
<img style="float: right; margin: 20px" src="https://raw.github.com/ecerami/ecerami.github.io/master/img/match_miner.png" width=250px> <a href="https://matchminer.org/">MatchMiner</a> is an open source computational platform for matching patient-specific genomic profiles to precision cancer medicine clinical trials.  It is currently in active use within DFCI and now available to both trial investigators and practicing oncologists.

# Profile and ImmunoProfile

Profile is a long-standing clinical next-generation sequencing (NGS) project between DFCI, Brigham and Women's Hospital, and Boston Children's Hospital.  For Profile, we are actively developing new clinical NGS pipelines and a new cloud-based platform for running all clinical NGS tests.  We also support ImmunoProfile, a new research assay used to study and predict response to Immunotherapy.
