## cBioPortal for Cancer Genomics

<img style="float: right; margin: 20px" src="http://www.cbioportal.org/images/cbioportal_logo.png" width=250px>

The <a href="http://cbioportal.org">cBioPortal for Cancer Genomics</a> is one of the most widely used platforms for visualizing and analyzing cancer genomics data. The project is <a href="https://github.com/cBioPortal/">fully open source</a>, and is actively maintained by multiple groups, including KSG @ DFCI, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, Princess Margaret Cancer Center and <a href="http://thehyve.nl">The Hyve</a>.  We also actively maintain a local instance of cBioPortal @ DFCI, where we enable researchers at DFCI to mine all genomic data generated by the Profile project, our enterprise sequencing effort for all patients. 

## Human Tumor Atlas Network (HTAN)

Together with Sage Bionetworks, the Institute for Systems Biology, and Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, we are the Data Coordinating Center (DCC) for the <a href="https://humantumoratlas.org/">Human Tumor Atlas Network (HTAN)</a>.  HTAN is a large "Moonshot" project funded by the National Cancer Institute, which will focus on longitudinal studies of pre-cancer, metastasis, and drug resistance with an emphasis on collecting comprehensive clinical data over time.  The DCC is the central data coordinating center for the network. 


## MatchMiner Genomics
<a href="https://matchminer.org/">MatchMiner Genomics</a> is an open source computational platform for matching patient-specific genomic profiles to precision cancer medicine clinical trials. It is currently in active use within DFCI and available to both trial investigators and practicing oncologists.

## MatchMiner-AI
MatchMiner-AI is a next-generation trial matching platform that leverages large language models (LLMs) to match patients to all clinical trials — not just genomically driven ones — based on their full medical record. Where MatchMiner Genomics excels at structured genomic matching, MatchMiner-AI processes unstructured clinical notes to extract key patient attributes such as cancer type, burden of disease, prior treatment, and biomarkers, then generates patient summaries to identify the best-fit trials across the full portfolio. The platform launched at DFCI in February 2026.

## Profile and ImmunoProfile

Profile is a long-standing clinical next-generation sequencing (NGS) project between DFCI, Brigham and Women's Hospital, and Boston Children's Hospital.  For Profile, we are actively developing new clinical NGS pipelines and a new cloud-based platform for running all clinical NGS tests.  We also support ImmunoProfile, a research assay used to study and predict response to Immunotherapy.
