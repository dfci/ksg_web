<p class="detail-lead">
MatchMiner Genomics is an open source computational platform for matching patients to precision cancer medicine clinical trials based on their genomic profile. The platform is in active clinical use at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, where it helps oncologists and trial investigators identify genomically eligible patients for open trials — accelerating trial accrual and connecting patients to potentially life-saving therapies.

## Clinical Impact

MatchMiner Genomics is embedded in the clinical workflow at Dana-Farber, operating on genomic data from the Profile project — one of the most comprehensive clinical sequencing efforts in the US. By surfacing trial matches at the point of care, the platform reduces the time and effort required for oncologists to identify trial options, helping patients access precision medicine trials faster.

The platform is actively used by both clinical trial investigators (to identify eligible patients for their studies) and practicing oncologists (to explore trial options for individual patients), making it a two-sided tool for accelerating genomically driven clinical research.
