<p class="detail-lead">
The Human Tumor Atlas Network (HTAN) is an NCI Cancer Moonshot initiative focused on building three-dimensional atlases of the cellular, morphological, and molecular features of human cancers as they evolve from precancerous lesions to advanced disease. KSG @ Dana-Farber serves as the Data Coordinating Center (DCC) alongside <a href="https://sagebionetworks.org/">Sage Bionetworks</a>, the <a href="https://www.systemsbiology.org/">Institute for Systems Biology</a>, and <a href="https://www.mskcc.org/">Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center</a>.

## What We Do

<div class="feature-grid">
  <div class="feature-card">
    <div class="feature-card-title">Data Coordination</div>
    <p class="feature-card-desc">Manage and coordinate the submission, validation, and release of data across all HTAN research centers, ensuring completeness and consistency.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="feature-card">
    <div class="feature-card-title">Metadata Standards</div>
    <p class="feature-card-desc">Develop and maintain the HTAN data model — a standardized metadata schema covering biospecimens, assays, clinical data, and files across all centers.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="feature-card">
    <div class="feature-card-title">Data Portal</div>
    <p class="feature-card-desc">Build and maintain the HTAN Data Portal, enabling researchers worldwide to explore, filter, and download multi-omic datasets from participating centers.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="feature-card">
    <div class="feature-card-title">Cloud Infrastructure</div>
    <p class="feature-card-desc">Make HTAN data accessible via multiple cloud platforms — Synapse, Google BigQuery, and the NCI Cancer Research Data Commons (CRDC/Gen3) — for scalable analysis.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="feature-card">
    <div class="feature-card-title">Single-Cell & Spatial Data</div>
    <p class="feature-card-desc">Support the collection and standardization of cutting-edge single-cell and spatially resolved datasets — including scRNA-seq, MIBI-TOF, CyCIF, and more.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="feature-card">
    <div class="feature-card-title">Longitudinal Studies</div>
    <p class="feature-card-desc">Coordinate longitudinal cohorts tracking cancer evolution — from precancerous lesions through metastasis and drug resistance — with comprehensive clinical annotation.</p>
  </div>

## About HTAN

HTAN brings together leading cancer research centers across the United States to study how cancers form, progress, and respond to treatment. Each HTAN center focuses on a specific cancer type or biological question — including colorectal cancer, breast cancer, lung cancer, melanoma, glioblastoma, and others — generating rich multi-omic datasets that are made openly available to the research community.

The network produces data from a wide range of technologies: bulk and single-cell RNA sequencing, whole-genome and targeted DNA sequencing, proteomics, imaging mass cytometry, multiplexed immunofluorescence, and spatial transcriptomics. All data is linked to clinical and pathological annotations and released under FAIR data principles.
