At our core, we write code and create software systems. Our work falls into two areas:

**Big Data Platforms** — We organize and curate genomic data from thousands of cancer patients, and build tools that help researchers analyze and visualize that data to enable research discovery. Examples include [cBioPortal for Cancer Genomics](projects) and the [Human Tumor Atlas Network (HTAN)](projects).

**Clinical Platforms** — We build software systems designed to help the next patient at DFCI by enabling precision cancer medicine in clinical practice. Examples include Profile, ImmunoProfile, [MatchMiner Genomics](projects), and [MatchMiner-AI](projects) — our AI-powered platform that uses large language models to match patients to all clinical trials based on their full medical record.

We are a [multidisciplinary team](team) of software engineers, computational biologists, bioinformatics engineers, and project managers — all working together and empowered to move quickly and iterate. We are strong believers in open source software.

Looking ahead, we see artificial intelligence as a transformative force across the continuum of cancer care — from detection and diagnosis to treatment — and are actively integrating AI across our platforms and research.
