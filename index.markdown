The Knowledge Systems Group (KSG) is an applied genomics software and data sciences group, focused on enabling cancer genomics research and precision cancer medicine at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute (DFCI).

We are an [interdisciplinary group](team) of computational biologists, bioinformatics engineers, and software developers, **all united in the fight against cancer**.  

We currently support a [large portfolio of projects](projects), in the areas of cancer genomics, immuno-oncology, clinical decision support, and data sharing.  

We are also growing, and always looking for new recruits to join our team.
